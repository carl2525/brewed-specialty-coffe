         <p>The ambiance was astonishing, relaxing and sooo soothing. Considering its expensive price I definitely love the food quality. Plus the coffees were refreshing and a must have. The meals were delicious and fulfilling, I also did not expect to be treated well by the humble staffs. ワ We enjoyed as a couple and we'll surely pay a visit again.</p>

         <p>highly recommended for me. staff are so kind and polite plus napaka maalaga pa to lessen the shot of coffee for my pamangkin since may coffee yung order niya (peppermint frappe) . the pasta itself (creamy mushroom) is 10/10 . the ambiance of the place is very relaxing specially night time kme pumunta. ?/p>
